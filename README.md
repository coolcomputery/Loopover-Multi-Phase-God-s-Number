# Loopover-Multi-Phase-God-s-Number
Calculates upper bound of God's number of a n x n Loopover board by extending a rectangle of solved tiles incrementally.

P.S. I know someone else has already implemented this same algorithm, since known upper bounds are at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gij270TVlA1sHmvvuyMXYKToGGpQKoBGbT2yYNwBe6I/edit#gid=0, but I couldn't find the code so I wrote my own version.

!!!WARNING!!!
There is a conflict for 5x5 loopover extending 3x4 to 4x4, probably a bug in my code.

source code coming soon
